# A string can be used as a separator to join a list of strings together into a single string using the join() method. For
# example you can create a string where each element in a list is separated by a space.

print(" ".join(["once", "upon", "a", "time"]))
# "once upon a time"

# The following example separates the string elements with three hyphens.
print("---".join(["once", "upon", "a", "time"]))
# "once---upon---a---time"
